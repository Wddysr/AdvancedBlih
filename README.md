# AdvancedBlih
Epitech's blih script, with few adds

##v0.2
Blih now stop yelling at you with stuff like : ```File "ablih.py" [...] raise Keyboard interrupt``` but instead display a friendly message when you Ctrl+C.

##v0.1
```-c | --credential``` option added : save the token (password's SHA512 hash) in "~/.blih_credentials" to avoid taping it each time
